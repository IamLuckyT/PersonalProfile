        <h1>Hey there 👋, Welcome to the about section.</h1>
        <p>
           <h3> Who am I? </h3>
            My name is Letlhogonolo Mothoagae, I am a student of life who in many ways is still paving his way through the world of technology. business and entrepreneurship. 
            I have a passion for technology and I am always eager to learn new things. I believe that technology has the power to change the world and I want to be a part of that change.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first love for technology began with video games, I was fascinated by how they were made and how they worked. 
            This led me to learn more about computers and programming, and I quickly fell in love with the world of technology.
            I remember when I first got introduced to programming in high school at Grade 11 during my Computer Applications Technology <b>(CAT)</b> class, 
            I was amazed at how I could create something from nothing using just code, that was then and there I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology.
            <br>
        <p>
            In high school I was a shy and quiet kid but my love for entrepreneurship forced me to learn how to get out of my box. in Grade 10 I joined an entrepreneurship programme called iValue by
            Valued Citizens in partnership with STRATE, the programme was a 3 year programme where they taught us everything regarding business and entrepreneurship and thats where my second love started.
            So if i wasnt going to be in tech I wouldve dabbled in Business hence when I was awarded the opportunity to be mentored by TL Sekhoahla who is the owner of <a href="mtrvision30.html">MTR VISION 30</a>, 
            I didnt think twice but took the opportunity with both hands.
